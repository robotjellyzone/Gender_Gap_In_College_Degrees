In this project, i am visualizing the gender gap in college degrees. I made this project as a part of Dataquest & AI Inclusive Scholarship Program, wherein i got the opportunity to learn the fundamental concepts, tools & frameworks of data science. 

In this project we are analysing the gender gap across various college degrees by creating a line charts to compare across various degree categories.
Following is the chart that we exported as image file.
